# Fall-Detection-System-using-YOLOv5
Falls are a common and unintentional accident that many people face globally. The severity of 
the consequences from a fall depends on the way the person fell and the impact with the ground 
or an object. In general, falls are rare in the normal activities of healthy individuals, but they can 
result in fatal or non-fatal incidents. However, falls are particularly dangerous for the elderly as 
they can lead to long-term problems or death. Therefore, the elderly require prompt attention in 
the event of a fall. To minimize the effects of a fall on the elderly, a rapid response method must 
be available. The system's response time to emergencies is crucial for patient recovery and 
survival, and medical personnel are working to reduce response time. A quick and proper 
notification method can help reduce response time and provide immediate medical attention, 
which can significantly reduce the negative impact of a fall or increase the patient's chances of 
survival.
This study introduces a multi-person fall detection system that utilizes a vision-based approach 
for fall detection based on a region-based convolutional neural network. A fixed camera 
captures images of people, and the system analyzes the images to determine their posture and 
orientation. The system classifies the event as a fall or non-fall based on the image provided, 
and if a fall is detected, it sends an alert to the relevant party. The system has a mean average 
precision of 0.9 in fall detection and detects a fall in an image within 3.8 seconds, which 
enhances the response time of medical professionals to minimize the adverse effects of a fall on 
the patient
